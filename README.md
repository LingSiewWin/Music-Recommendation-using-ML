# Music-Recommendation-using-ML
Music Recommendation using Machine Learning

📌 Overview

This project implements a music recommendation system using machine learning techniques. It analyzes audio features of songs and applies clustering and dimensionality reduction methods to suggest music similar to a given track. The dataset used contains various song attributes such as danceability, energy, acousticness, and tempo.

🚀 Features

Data Preprocessing: Cleans and transforms raw song data.

Feature Engineering: Extracts relevant audio features.

Dimensionality Reduction: Uses t-SNE for visualization.

Clustering: Implements K-Means clustering to group similar songs.

Recommendation System: Suggests songs based on audio features.

Data Visualization: Uses Seaborn & Matplotlib for insights.
